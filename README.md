# java-projects
This repository is a collection of Java projects that I have built while learning and exploring different concepts in Java programming. Unlike my practice codes repo, this one focuses on complete projects that demonstrate real-world applications of Java.
This repo is a work in progress. I will keep adding more projects as I continue learning and experimenting with Java.
